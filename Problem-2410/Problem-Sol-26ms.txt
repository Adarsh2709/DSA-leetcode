class Solution {
    public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);
        int i = 0, j = 0, counter = 0;
        while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                counter++;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return counter;
    }
}
This is just a standard two pointer question.
In this i just sort the both array so that minimum of both will be at first so that it become easy to get proper track of pointer without considering more things.
Now a while loop is there which tells that if any thing (considering Both the array) go beyond limit so just do not run while and return the counter.
Now counter is initialize with zero(0) and then just increase when it meets the condition if not just pointer of trainer (j) got plus.
In this way we can get the answer in easy way.

But this solution having 26ms.
I have solved it in 25ms just check that out too, May be your are also thinking in that way.
