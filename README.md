Hey Everyone!


I'm maintaining this repository to document the problems I solve and share the solutions I come up with along the way.

The purpose is simple:

If someone is stuck on a similar problem, they can refer to my approach for clarity.

If someone has a better or more optimized solution, they’re welcome to contribute—because learning improves through collaboration.


Why I’m doing this:

To create a personal library of solved problems and approaches.

To build a space where multiple perspectives on a single problem can exist.

To grow by exploring alternative ways of thinking and problem-solving.





Whether you're here to learn, contribute, or just browse—you're most welcome!
