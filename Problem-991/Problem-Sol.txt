class Solution {
    public int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        while(startValue<target){
            if(target%2==0){
                target = target/2;
            }
            else{
                target++;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count + (startValue-target);
    }
}
In this problem, I just think that if target is even i just divide it by 2 and if it is odd i just make it target = target - 1 so that it become even and put this into loop so that it will simply iterate till target become less than or equal to startvalue then just add their difference(i.e startvalue - target) and add it to count and we got the answer in very easy and simple way.
