class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
       Arrays.sort(nums);
       boolean check = false;
       if(nums.length==1){
        return false;
       }
       for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i-1]==nums[i]){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            check = true;
        }
       }
       if(check){
        return false;
       }
       return true;
    }
}

In this we need to check that if there is any number which repeated at least once we required to return true but if not then simply false.
But we all think first approach as two for loop or two pointers but it is not reliable as we cant handle very large input.
So I have used sorting as it take O(nlogn) so it can able to handle.
But more correct and best approach is to use Hash set.
