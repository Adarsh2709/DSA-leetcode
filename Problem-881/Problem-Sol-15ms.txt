This is a simple greedy algorithm problem.
In this we first sort the array so that I can try pairing the lightest and heaviest person together.
I use two pointers which is a from the start and b from the end.
If the sum of their weights is within the limit(i.e less than equal to limit), I can put both in one boat, so I move both pointers.
Otherwise, only the heavier person goes, so I move b only.
Then when a and b crosses each other the loop will break and we return the count;
